# Computer Networks Basic Characteristics

## Questions/Cues

- Fault-tolerant networks
- Scalable network
- Quality of Service (QoS)
- Security characteristics

## Notes

- A computer network should be:
  
  - Fault tolerance
    - Continue working despite failures
    - Ensure no loss of service
  
  - Scalability
    - E.g. the Internet
    - Grow based on the needs of the user
    - Maintain performance after growth
  
  - Quality of service
    - Ability to set priorities
    - E.g. give priority real time communication over email
    - Manage data traffic to reduce data loss/delay, etc.
- Security
  - Prevent
    - Unauthorized access
    - Misuse
    - Forgery
  - Provide
    - Confidentiality
    - Integrity of data
    - Availability

## Summary

Effective computer networks are characterized by fault tolerance, ensuring continuous operation and no service loss, scalability to grow with user needs while maintaining performance, quality of service for prioritizing data types and managing traffic, and robust security to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data confidentiality and integrity.
